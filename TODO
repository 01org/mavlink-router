 - TCP support: the main use is on local links, not remote links. We
   allow to receive new connection requests by listening to a known port and accepting
   connections; currently, this is be done by just creating a socket and adding
   the endpoint. If necessary we can allow clients to negotiate links to use
   shm or memfd

 - Allow drop-in override of configuration files

 - Add systemd service file

 - Eavesdrop vs normal endpoints (to bypass the routing restrictions)

 - Add .bin (ArduPilot) support for logging

 - Allow to save logs (.ulog and .bin) to disk with proper rotation

 - Tests: make them more abrangent (maybe even unit tests?) and integrate on some
   CI platform.
