 - Keep a routing table with the systemdid and componentid available on each
   endpoint so we can transition from having a "master" endpoint to something
   allowing one endpoint talk to the other

 - Add TCP support: the main use is on local links, not remote links. We should
   allow to receive new connection requests by listening to a known port and accepting
   connections; initially this can be done as just creating a socket and adding
   the endpoint. If necessary we can allow clients to negotiate links to use
   shm or memfd

 - Add configuration file (INI format): mandating each endpoint to be written
   to the command-line was an "easy to bootstrap" way for mavlink-router. However
   it's not ideal since changing the endpoints involves changing the init scripts.
   
   We need to add a simple INI parser that has the configuration for the endpoints

 - Add systemd service file

 - Eavesdrop vs normal endpoints (to bypass the routing restrictions)

 - Allow endpoints to filter messages without receiving them

 - Add .ulog (PX4) and .bin (ArduPilot) support for logging

 - Allow to save logs (.ulog and .bin) to disk with proper rotation
